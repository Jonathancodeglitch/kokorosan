        <h3>To Kokoro-san</h3>
        <p>
          Hey baby I know you said not to call or text you, and I agreed but I'm
          sorry I don't think I can stop talking to you, we can't go back to
          being just strangers I love you too much for that and I'm sorry I
          allowed my emotions take the best of me and I ended up neglecting you
          which was wrong , I broke your heart again and again at this point you
          would say it's always something new, I see reasons why you would want
          to close this chapter but please don't we just had a rough year
          they're many more years ahead of us don't give up on us just yet, I
          would keep trying and growing to become a better man for you and to
          give you a happy life, I'm so sorry kokoro-san.<br/><br/> wanted to wish you
          earlier but didn't finish making this on time, merry Christmas baby
          may peace, love prosperity and jonathan follow you always. sayÂ Amen
